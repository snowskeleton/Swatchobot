# Swatchobot
This collection of scripts was put together in an effort to provide a bot for a Minecraft server hosted in Docker. 

Features of note:

  * Use of Docker!
  * Use of SQLite to keep logs and also store data
  * Discovery and use of Swatch, a log monotering deamon
  * Liberal use of RegEx to capture and compute strings
  * Complicated BASH usage
  * Careful separation of separate functions into separate files to aid in comprehension
